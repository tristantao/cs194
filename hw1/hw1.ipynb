      "\n",
      "Entity resolution, also known as record deduplication, is the process of identifying rows in one or more data sets that refer to the same real world entity.\n",
      "Take an example.\n",
      "You're on ebay looking for a [hip data science accessory][sliderulewiki], but you're on a budget, so you decide to scrape the [ebay listings][ebay] for a few days to get a feel for the market.\n",
      "Unfortunately, the listings are confusing and you don't know how to aggregate them.\n",
      "Entity resolution to the rescue!\n",
      "You find an [authoritative database][sliderules] and map all the ebay listings to it.\n",
      "Now you can comparison shop, get that sweet Keuffel and Esser for way cheap, and impress all the data hipsters.\n",
      "\n",
      "But finding matching records is a hard problem in general.\n",
      "A major reason is that the criteria for identifying duplicates are often vague and impossible to encode in rules.\n",
      "In addition, from a purely computational perspective, the problem is quadratic in the size of its inputs: naively, all pairs of records need to be compared to find all the duplicates.\n",
      "In this assignment, we will begin to address both these challenges.\n",

On the other hand, some token weights only depend on the token, and are the same everywhere that token is found.  We call these weights `global`, and IDF is one such weight.\n",

important pages. in addition it's difficult to share data kept in a conventional paper notebook and they're only good for capturing one kind of information: handwritten notes. when it's time to gather information from other sources and in different ways other difficulties can arise. for instance because most people don't have a way of digitally capturing unstructured information they often print out web research and store information in file folders or on desks which is difficult to find later and inaccessible when you're away. and sharing information with others can be challenging--even when using e-mail it can be hard to hard to figure out what the plan is without reading through long e-mail threads that may or may not contain the information you need. onenote 2007 however gives you a

communication coordination and information sharing can challenge group effectiveness and productivity. teams often rely on e-mail messages to share information causing confusion and bloated e-mail inboxes. tasks action items agendas and issues stored within static documents or document management systems are difficult to update track and access and they prevent multiple people from working with the same information at the same time. onenote 2007 helps people work together better by eliminating roadblocks that arise when information is isolated in paper notes or file folders or on one person's computer. groups can share information easily work more productively and keep track of projects issues and goals more effectively. individuals can work together from the same

knowledge base so that everyone has access to the same information helping to get new team members up to speed quickly and minimizing duplicate efforts. share notes even with non-onenote 2007 users by sending your notes as html so that anyone with an e-mail client or web browser can view them and stay in control of your information by choosing which notebooks to share with your teammates and which to keep private and help ensure privacy with password protection. you can even use onenote 2007 as a shared digital whiteboard enabling virtual teams to work together in real time viewing and editing the same set of notes. microsoft 99.95\n",
